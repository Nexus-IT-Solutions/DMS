For #file:EditPWDRecord.jsx and #file:EditPWDRecord.jsx I just want it like #file:RegisterPWD.jsx .

The #file:RegisterPWD.jsx is for registration and I want you to use it has reference to buld the edit pages. This is how the user data is when the edit pages first loads it: curl https://disability-management-api.onrender.com/v1/pwd-records/24

So just like the register pwd, show all fields that the user filled in edit edit pages and the ones that the user did not fill, remove it from the edit pages except the status, profile image and supporting document logic whic are in the edit pages. So just like how the user filled the forms to register a pwd, the same way and logic the user is going to do just that this time the user is going to edit what they filled.

So look at how the communities, assistance types, disability categories, disability type, and gender where working or where fetched and implement that logic here. So example like the community, it has to be a select and you have to load all the communities just that, what the user selected or the id of the community that was returnened(community name using the id) will be automatically selected so that if the user likes it, they will choose a different community or maintain the original one. Also implement the logic for the age and DOB and also the age and other fields just like what was in the register pwd component. So when the user changes the age in the edit and the age is 18 or above, the other fields like guadian, etc.. will show already prefilled allowing the user to also make edit. With this, i think I have explain all that I know. Now help me implement it. if you don't understand anything, tell me before proceeding.
